  Welcome to my website! I'm an Informatics Engineering student at Minhoâ€™s University and I'm excited to share my professional journey with you!

### Software Development
  As an Informatics Engineering student, I have gained a solid foundation in software development. My university education has provided me with the tools and knowledge to work on large-scale software projects in a professional setting. I have experience working with Agile development methodologies, which have taught me to work efficiently and adapt to changes in project requirements.

  One of the things I enjoy most about software development is the problem-solving aspect. I have had to work through a variety of challenges throughout my university studies and I've learned to think critically and come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles.

### Cybersecurity
  Since I discovered my love for cybersecurity, I've been working to expand my understanding and improve the security of high-tech systems. I've been actively engaged in penetration testing and research since 2016, participating in platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and others. I love the thrill of discovering vulnerabilities and finding ways to fix them.

### Aviation
  The integration of technology in modern aviation systems presents unique cybersecurity challenges that require a multi-disciplinary approach to address. I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of cybersecurity and aviation safety and gaining a deeper understanding of the potential threats and vulnerabilities in these systems.

### Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain
  I'm also intrigued by the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in this area and explore new ways to apply it to different industries.

### Freelance Work
  In addition to my academic studies, I've also gained practical experience through freelance work on platforms such as Upwork, where I provided services as a Linux System Administrator, custom software development, websiste management and development, and ethical hacking. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and creating solutions.

  On this website, you can discover my skills, experiences, and projects, and how they can benefit you and your business. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you.
