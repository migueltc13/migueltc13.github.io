<p>&nbsp;On this website, you can discover my skills, experiences, and projects, and how they can benefit you and your business. Thank you for visiting! Looking forward to connecting with you.</p>

## Software Development
<p>&nbsp;As an Informatics Engineering student, I have gained a solid foundation in software development. My university education has provided me with the tools and knowledge to work on large-scale software projects in a professional setting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I have experience working with Agile development methodologies, which have taught me to work efficiently and adapt to changes in project requirements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;One of the things I enjoy most about software development is the problem-solving aspect. I have had to work through a variety of challenges throughout my university studies and I've learned to think critically and come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles.</p>

## Cybersecurity
<p>&nbsp;Since I discovered my passion for cybersecurity, I've been working to expand my understanding and improve the security of high-tech systems. I've been actively engaged in penetration testing and research since 2016, participating in platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and others. I love the thrill of discovering vulnerabilities and finding ways to fix them.</p>

## Aviation
<p>&nbsp;The integration of technology in modern aviation systems presents unique cybersecurity challenges that require a multi-disciplinary approach to address. I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of cybersecurity and aviation safety and gaining a deeper understanding of the potential threats and vulnerabilities in these systems.</p>

## Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain
<p>&nbsp;I'm also intrigued by the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in this area and explore new ways to apply it to different industries.</p>

## Freelance Work
<p>&nbsp;In addition to my academic studies, I've also gained practical experience through freelance work on platforms such as Upwork, where I provided services as a Linux System Administrator, custom software development, website management and development, and ethical hacking. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and creating solutions.</p>
